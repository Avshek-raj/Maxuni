					<description><![CDATA[Effects of consuming too much coffee]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Coffee contain <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine">caffeine</a>, a substance that may boost your mood, metabolism and mental and physical performance.</p>



<p>Studies have also shown that it’s safe for most people when consumed in low-to-moderate amounts .</p>



<p>However, high doses of caffeine may have unpleasant and even dangerous side effects.</p>



<p>Research has shown that your genes have a major influence on your tolerance to it. Some can consume much more caffeine than others without experiencing negative effects.</p>



<p>What’s more, individuals who aren’t used to caffeine may experience symptoms after consuming what is typically considered a moderate dose .</p>



<p>Some side effects of too consuming much caffeine are below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2000" height="1333" src="/https://avshek-raj.github.io/Maxuni/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Coffee-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-127"/></figure>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>1. Anxiety</h2>



<p>Caffeine is known to increase alertness.</p>



<p>It works by blocking the effects of adenosine, a brain chemical that makes you feel tired. At the same time, it triggers the release of adrenaline, the “fight-or-flight” hormone associated with increased energy.</p>



<p>However, at higher doses, these effects may become more pronounced, leading to anxiety and nervousness.</p>



<p>In fact, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is one of four caffeine-related syndromes listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association.</p>



<p>Extremely high daily intakes of 1,000 mg or more per day have been reported to cause nervousness, jitteriness and similar symptoms in most people, whereas even a moderate intake may lead to similar effects in caffeine-sensitive individuals .</p>



<p>Additionally, modest doses have been shown to cause rapid breathing and increase stress levels when consumed in one sitting .</p>



<p>One study in 25 healthy men found that those who ingested approximately 300 mg of caffeine experienced more than double the stress of those who took a placebo.</p>



<p>Interestingly, stress levels were similar between regular and less frequent caffeine consumers, suggesting the compound may have the same effect on stress levels regardless of whether you drink it habitually.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, these results are preliminary.</p>



<p>Coffee’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-caffeine-in-coffee">caffeine content</a>&nbsp;is highly variable. For reference, a large (“grande”) coffee at Starbucks contains about 330 mg of caffeine.</p>



<p>If you notice that you often feel nervous or jittery, it might be a good idea to look at your caffeine intake and cut it back.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>2. Insomnia</h2>



<p>Caffeine’s ability to help people stay awake is one of its most prized qualities.</p>



<p>On the other hand, too much caffeine can make it difficult to get enough restorative sleep.</p>



<p>Studies have found that higher caffeine intake appears to increase the amount of time it takes to fall asleep. It may also decrease total sleeping time, especially in the elderly.</p>



<p>By contrast, low or moderate amounts of caffeine don’t seem to affect sleep very much in people considered “good sleepers,” or even those with self-reported insomnia .</p>



<p>You may not realize that too much caffeine is interfering with your sleep if you underestimate the amount of caffeine you’re taking in.</p>



<p>Although coffee and tea are the most concentrated sources of caffeine, it is also found in soda, cocoa, energy drinks and several types of medication.</p>



<p>For example, an energy shot may contain up to 350 mg of caffeine, while some energy drinks provide as much as a whopping 500 mg per can .</p>



<p>Importantly, the amount of caffeine you can consume without affecting your sleep will depend on your genetics and other factors.</p>



<p>In addition, caffeine consumed later in the day may interfere with sleep because its effects can take several hours to wear off.</p>



<p>Research has shown that while caffeine remains in your system for an average of five hours, the time period may range from one and a half hours to nine hours, depending on the individual.</p>



<p>One study investigated how the timing of caffeine ingestion affects sleep. Researchers gave 12 healthy adults 400 mg of caffeine either six hours before bedtime, three hours before bedtime or immediately prior to bedtime.</p>



<p>Both the time it took all three groups to fall asleep and the time they spent awake at night increased significantly.</p>



<p>These results suggest that it’s important to pay attention to both the amount and timing of caffeine to optimize your sleep.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>3. Digestive Issues</h2>



<p>Many people find that a morning cup of coffee helps get their bowels moving.</p>



<p>Coffee’s laxative effect has been attributed to the release of gastrin, a hormone the stomach produces that speeds up activity in the colon. What’s more, decaffeinated coffee has been shown to produce a similar response .</p>



<p>However, caffeine itself also seems to stimulate bowel movements by increasing peristalsis, the contractions that move food through your digestive tract ..</p>



<p>Given this effect, it’s not surprising that large doses of caffeine may lead to loose stools or even diarrhea in some people.</p>



<p>Although for many years coffee was believed to cause stomach ulcers, a large study of more than 8,000 people didn’t find any link between the two .</p>



<p>On the other hand, some studies suggest that caffeinated beverages may worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in some people. This seems to be especially true of coffee.</p>



<p>In a small study, when five healthy adults drank caffeinated water, they experienced a relaxation of the muscle that keeps stomach contents from moving up into the throat — the hallmark of GERD .</p>



<p>Since coffee can have major effects on digestive function, you may want to cut back on the amount you drink or switch to tea if you experience any issues.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>4. Muscle Breakdown</h2>



<p>Rhabdomyolysis is a very serious condition in which damaged muscle fibers enter the bloodstream, leading to kidney failure and other problems.</p>



<p>Common causes of rhabdomyolysis include trauma, infection, drug abuse, muscle strain and bites from poisonous snakes or insects.</p>



<p>In addition, there have been several reports of rhabdomyolysis related to excessive caffeine intake, although this is relatively rare</p>



<p>In one case, a woman developed nausea, vomiting and dark urine after drinking 32 ounces (1 liter) of coffee containing roughly 565 mg of caffeine. Fortunately, she recovered after being treated with medication and fluids</p>



<p>Importantly, this is a large dosage of caffeine to consume within a short period of time, especially for someone who isn’t used to it or is highly sensitive to its effects.</p>



<p>In order to reduce the risk of rhabdomyolysis, it’s best to limit your intake to about 250 mg of caffeine per day, unless you’re used to consuming more.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>5. Addiction</h2>



<p>Despite all of caffeine’s health benefits, there’s no denying that it may become habit-forming.</p>



<p>A detailed review suggests that although caffeine triggers certain brain chemicals similarly to the way cocaine and amphetamines do, it does not cause classic addiction the way these drugs do.</p>



<p>However, it may lead to psychological or physical dependency, especially at high dosages.</p>



<p>In one study, 16 people who typically consumed high, moderate or no caffeine took part in a word test after going without caffeine overnight. Only high caffeine users showed a bias for caffeine-related words and had strong caffeine cravings.</p>



<p>Additionally, the frequency of caffeine intake seems to play a role in dependency.</p>



<p>In another study, 213 caffeine users completed questionnaires after going 16 hours without consuming it. Daily users had greater increases in headaches, fatigue and other withdrawal symptoms than non-daily users.</p>



<p>Even though the compound does not seem to cause true addiction, if you regularly drink a lot of coffee or other caffeinated beverages, there’s a very good chance you may become dependent on its effects.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>6. High Blood Pressure</h2>



<p>Overall, caffeine doesn’t seem to increase the risk of heart disease or stroke in most people.</p>



<p>However, it has been shown to raise blood pressure in several studies due to its stimulatory effect on the nervous system.</p>



<p>Elevated blood pressure is a risk factor for heart attack and stroke because it may damage arteries over time, restricting the flow of blood to your heart and brain.</p>



<p>Fortunately, caffeine’s effect on blood pressure seems to be temporary. Also, it seems to have the strongest impact on people who aren’t used to consuming it.</p>



<p>High caffeine intake has also been shown to raise blood pressure during exercise in healthy people, as well as in those with mildly elevated blood pressure.</p>



<p>Therefore, paying attention to the dosage and timing of caffeine is important, especially if you already have high blood pressure.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>7. Rapid Heart Rate</h2>



<p>The stimulatory effects of high caffeine intake may cause your heart to beat faster.</p>



<p>It may also lead to altered heartbeat rhythm, called atrial fibrillation, which has been reported in young people who consumed energy drinks containing extremely high doses of caffeine.</p>



<p>In one case study, a woman who took a massive dose of caffeine powder and tablets in an attempted suicide developed a very rapid heart rate, kidney failure and other serious health issues.</p>



<p>However, this effect doesn’t seem to occur in everyone. Indeed, even some people with heart problems may be able to tolerate large amounts of caffeine without any adverse effects.</p>



<p>In one controlled study, when 51 heart failure patients consumed 100 mg of caffeine per hour for five hours, their heart rates and rhythms remained normal.</p>



<p>Regardless of the mixed study results, if you notice any changes in your heart rate or rhythm after drinking caffeinated beverages, consider decreasing your intake.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>8. Fatigue</h2>



<p>Coffee, tea and other caffeinated beverages are known to boost energy levels.</p>



<p>However, they can also have the opposite effect by leading to rebound fatigue after the caffeine leaves your system.</p>



<p>One review of 41 studies found that although caffeinated energy drinks increased alertness and improved mood for several hours, participants were often more tired than usual the following day .</p>



<p>Of course, if you continue to drink lots of caffeine throughout the day, you can avoid the rebound effect. On the other hand, this may affect your ability to sleep.</p>



<p>To maximize caffeine’s benefits on energy and avoid rebound fatigue, consume it in moderate rather than high doses.</p>



<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>9. Frequent Urination and Urgency</h2>



<p>Increased urination is a common side effect of high caffeine intake due to the compound’s stimulatory effects on the bladder.</p>



<p>You may have noticed that you need to urinate frequently when you drink more coffee or tea than usual.</p>



<p>Most research looking at the compound’s effects on urinary frequency has focused on older people and those with overactive bladders or incontinence.</p>



<p>In one study, 12 young to middle-aged people with overactive bladders who consumed 2 mg of caffeine per pound (4.5 mg per kilogram) of body weight daily experienced significant increases in urinary frequency and urgency.</p>



<p>For someone weighing 150 pounds (68 kg), this would equate to about 300 mg of caffeine per day.</p>



<p>In addition, high intake may increase the likelihood of developing incontinence in people with healthy bladders.</p>



<p>One large study looked at the effects of high caffeine intake on incontinence in more than 65,000 women without incontinence.</p>



<p>Those who consumed more than 450 mg daily had a significantly increased risk of incontinence, compared to those who consumed less than 150 mg per day.</p>



<p>If you drink a lot of caffeinated beverages and feel that your urination is more frequent or urgent than it should be, it may be a good idea to cut back on your intake to see if your symptoms improve. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p>Light-to-moderate caffeine intake seems to provide impressive health benefits in many people.</p>



<p>On the other hand, very high dosages may lead to side effects that interfere with day-to-day living and might even cause serious health issues.</p>



<p>Although responses vary from person to person, the effects of high intake demonstrate that more isn’t necessarily better.</p>



<p>To get the benefits of caffeine without undesirable effects, conduct an honest assessment of your sleep, energy levels and other factors that might be affected, and reduce your intake if needed.</p>

<p>Coffee can be healthy and non healthy at the same time. It&#8217;s healthy or not  depends on the way that you consume it. If we intake it the right way it is healthy and advantageous if not it can be very disadvantageous and can lead to many harmful symptoms.</p>



<p>Coffee is a beloved beverage known for its ability to fine-tune your focus and boost your energy levels. Many people depend on their daily cup of coffee right when they wake up to get their day started on the right foot refreshed and active.</p>



<p>In addition to its energizing effects, coffee has been linked to a long list of potential health benefits, giving you all the more reason to get brewing.</p>



<p>In this article we have brought you some top evidence based benefits on coffee.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" src="/https://avshek-raj.github.io/Maxuni/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Coffee-Feature.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-120"/></figure>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><strong>Benefits of Coffee</strong></span></h2>



<h2><a>1. It Boosts energy levels</a></h2>



<p>Coffee contains <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine">caffeine</a>, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels .</p>



<p>This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this increases levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine .</p>



<p>One small study found that consuming caffeine increased time to exhaustion during a cycling exercise by 12% and significantly reduced subjective levels of fatigue in participants .</p>



<p>Another study had similar findings, reporting that consuming caffeine before and during a round of golf improved performance, increased subjective energy levels, and reduced feelings of fatigue.</p>



<h2><a>2. Linked to a lower risk of depression</a></h2>



<p>Some studies have found that drinking coffee could be associated with a lower risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/caffeine-and-depression">depression</a>.</p>



<p>According to one review of seven studies, each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to an 8% lower risk of depression .</p>



<p>Another study found that drinking at least four cups of coffee each day was associated with a significantly lower risk of depression, compared with drinking just one cup per day .</p>



<p>What’s more, one study in more than 200,000 people showed that drinking coffee was linked to a lower risk of death by suicide.</p>



<h2><a>3. Supports heart health</a></h2>



<p>Some research shows that drinking coffee may benefit heart health.</p>



<p>In fact, one review found that drinking three to five cups of coffee per day was tied to a 15% reduced risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease">heart disease</a>&nbsp;.</p>



<p>Another review of 21 studies showed that drinking three to four cups of coffee daily was associated with a 21% lower risk of stroke .</p>



<p>What’s more, one study in more than 21,000 people also found that increased coffee intake was associated with a significantly decreased risk of heart failure.</p>



<p>However, keep in mind that caffeine could affect&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-and-blood-pressure">blood pressure levels</a>. Therefore, people with unmanaged blood pressure may need to limit or moderate their caffeine intake .</p>



<h2><a>4. Could support brain health</a></h2>



<p>Although studies have turned up mixed results, some research suggests that coffee may help protect against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-coffee-may-help-prevent-alzheimers-parkinsons">Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease</a>.</p>



<p>According to one review of 13 studies, people who regularly consumed caffeine had a significantly lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. What’s more, caffeine consumption also slowed the progression of Parkinson’s disease over time (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7353179/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9Trusted Source</a>).</p>



<p>Another review of 11 observational studies in more than 29,000 people also found that the more coffee people consumed, the lower their risk of Alzheimer’s disease .</p>



<p>Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that moderate coffee consumption could be associated with a lower risk of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-coffee-and-tea-can-help-lower-the-risk-of-stroke-dementia">dementia</a> and cognitive decline .</p>



<h2><a>5. May promote weight management</a></h2>



<p>According to some research, coffee could alter fat storage and support gut health, both of which may be beneficial for weight management .</p>



<p>For example, one review of 12 studies concluded that higher coffee consumption could be associated with decreased body fat, especially in men .</p>



<p>In another study, increased coffee intake was linked to decreased body fat in women .</p>



<p>Furthermore, one study found that people who drank one to two cups of coffee per day were 17% more likely to meet recommended physical activity levels, compared with those who drank less than one cup per day .</p>



<p>Higher levels of physical activity could help promote weight management .</p>

<p>We know the impacts climate change can have on our planet, but what effects can it have on our health? Healthline’s TRANSFORM: Future of Health series explores what’s next in health and wellness.</p>



<h2><a>6. Could protect against liver conditions</a></h2>



<p>Interestingly, several studies suggest that coffee could support liver health and protect against disease.</p>



<p>For instance, one study found that drinking more than two cups of coffee per day was linked to lower rates of liver scarring and liver cancer in people with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/liver-diseases">liver disease</a>.</p>



<p>Other research shows that the more coffee people drank, the lower their risk of death from chronic liver disease. Drinking one cup of coffee per day was tied to a 15% lower risk, while drinking four cups per day was linked to a 71% lower risk.</p>



<p>Another recent study found that coffee consumption was associated with decreased liver stiffness, which is a measure healthcare professionals use to assess fibrosis, the formation of scar tissue in the liver.</p>



<h2><a>7. Could increase longevity</a></h2>



<p>Some research suggests that coffee could help extend longevity, thanks to its multitude of potential health benefits.</p>



<p>For example, one review of 40 studies concluded that drinking two to four cups of coffee daily was associated with a lower risk of death, regardless of factors like age, weight status, and alcohol consumption .</p>



<p>Similarly, another study in 1,567 people found that drinking caffeinated coffee was linked to a lower risk of death after 12 and 18 years of follow-up. Furthermore, drinking at least one cup of coffee per day was also associated with a lower risk of death from cancer.</p>



<p>Interestingly, one test-tube study showed that coffee was able to significantly extend the life span of yeast by protecting against <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/oxidative-stress">free radicals</a> and DNA damage.</p>



<p>However, more research is needed to determine whether this could also apply to humans.</p>



<h2><a>8. May enhance athletic performance</a></h2>



<p>Coffee is often used as an ergogenic aid by athletes looking to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/caffeine-and-exercise">improve performance</a>&nbsp;and increase energy levels (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/ergogenic-aid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30</a>).</p>



<p>An ergogenic aid is also called a performance enhancer.</p>



<p>One review of nine studies reported that <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-before-workout">drinking coffee before exercise</a> improved people’s endurance and decreased their perceived exertion, compared with a control group.</p>



<p>Another study in 126 older adults found that drinking coffee was associated with improved physical performance and faster gait speed, even after the researchers adjusted for factors like age, belly fat, and physical activity levels .</p>



<p>Additionally, a large review reported that moderate caffeine consumption could slightly improve power output and time-trial completion time. However, results varied, so the researchers also noted that caffeine may affect people differently .</p>



<h2><a>9. It may be linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes</a></h2>



<p>Some research suggests that consuming coffee regularly could be associated with a decreased risk of developing<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes"> </a>type 2 diabetes&nbsp;over the long term.</p>



<p>In fact, one review of 30 studies found that each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to a 6% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes .</p>



<p>This is thought to be due to coffee’s ability to preserve the function of the beta cells in your pancreas, which are responsible for producing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/insulin">insulin</a>&nbsp;to regulate blood sugar levels .</p>



<p>Plus, it’s rich in <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-worlds-biggest-source-of-antioxidants">antioxidants</a> and may affect insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and metabolism — all of which are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes .</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Coffee is a popular beverage that researchers have studied extensively for its many health benefits, including its ability to increase energy levels, promote weight management, enhance athletic performance, and protect against chronic disease.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that some people may need to limit their intake, including people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, children and adolescents, and people with certain health conditions .</p>



<p>Still, drinking coffee in moderation — about three to four cups per day — has been associated with several health benefits and is generally considered safe for most adults </p>
